    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to ECE 311: Digital Signal Processing Lab! The main goals of this course are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reinforce the concepts you learn in ECE 310.\n",
    "* Give you experience with Python, which is a popular programming language for work in signal processing, machine learning, and many other fields.\n",
    "* Demonstrate the applications of signal processing within and beyond the context of ECE 310. And hopefully encourage you to take more courses in Signal Processing!\n",
    "\n",
    "This first lab will serve as an introduction to Python and the scripting environment we will use throughout the class, Jupyter (or IPython) Notebooks. To be clear, **ECE 311 is not a programming class**! The students in ECE 311 have a wide range of programming experience, and we want the focus of the course to be on the fundamental tools and interesting applications of signal processing. With that said, we expect you to become more comfortable with Python as the semester goes on and hope you take the time to understand your code. In this lab, we will cover the basic syntax, data types, and a few more advanced techniques that are commonly used when programming in Python. Let's get started!"

    "Python is an object-oriented scripting language that is popular due to its ease of development and tremendous assortment of libraries. The environment we are working in is called a Jupyter Notebook. Each notebook is composed of a collection of code and markdown cells. Markdown cells are those like this one that show text and headings, while code cells execute Python code. In order to run a cell, simply click on the cell and press Ctrl+Enter, Shift+Enter, or the \"Play\" button on the toolbar. To add or remove cells, click on the \"Insert\" and \"Edit\" tabs in the toolbar, respectively. In the below code cell, we will import three common libraries: numpy (Numerical Python), skimage (Image Processing), matplotlib (implementation of popular MATLAB plotting functions), and a couple other helpful utilities. Go ahead and run the next cell."

    "### Arrays, Lists, and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the most important data types in Python are (numpy) arrays, lists, and dictionaries. In the below code cell, we explore several ways to create and manipulate these data types. But first, let's discuss their differences. Arrays in Python are like the arrays you may be familiar with from C or C++. They are fixed-sized, ordered collections of variables. Unlike other languages however, numpy arrays can mix data types. In order to access an element in an array, we supply an index in square brackets. If we have a multidimensional array, like an image, we can supply two indices, where the first index is the row and the second index is the column of the array we would like to access. This means that numpy arrays are \"row major\". **It is best to separate these indices with a comma**. It is important to note that Python zero-indexes its objects. Therefore, if you want the very first element in your array, you should use index \"0\". We will use numpy arrays the most in this class since they interface seemlessly with all the libraries we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are similar to arrays except they do not have a fixed size upon instantiation. Below, you can see how the $\\textrm{append()}$ method allows us to place a new element at the end of a list. For those of you familiar with C++ or Java, lists are similar to vectors in these languages. It is common practice to create a list first to store data we do not know the size of, then typecast the list to a numpy array for convenience in later work. **This point is especially important! Take note of how we typecast from list to numpy array below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are associative arrays that allow us to store key-value pairs together. Keys are like indices for lists and arrays, except they need not be integers! They can also be strings, floats, tuples, and more. Dictionaries are a great way to store information that is not necessarily ordered or should be referenced by more descriptive information than an integer index. We will not use dictionaries much in this class; however, an introduction to Python would be incomplete without discussing dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the below code cell and please play around with the syntax. See what works, see what breaks, try printing different variables you create."

    "\n",
    "Now let's look at some control structures. Most of you should be familiar with \"if-else\" statements (conditional structures) and iterative structures like \"for\" and \"while\" loops. Still, let's do a quick review.\n",
    "\n",
    "If-else statements check if a (boolean) condition is true. **If** this condition is true, we execute the related code; **else** we execute different code. We can create a chain of if-else statements to try several conditions at a particular point in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops execute a segment of code as we go through a predetermined set of values for a variable. In Python, all for loops are created as **iterators**. This means we do not count from 0 to 10, for example, like in C. Instead, our iterating variable goes through a collection of values we give it. This may be confusing at first, but it is incredibly convenient, so don't get frustrated if it doesn't make sense immediately. We strongly suggest you play around with the below code examples if you want some practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "While loops, though we will use them infrequently, allow us to execute a piece of code until a condition is met. Be careful when using while loops to make sure the condition will be eventually met or overriden. Otherwise, your code will run forever!\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing we should note is that Python is a white-space drive language. This means we do not use curly braces {} to indicate the scope of a control structure, instead we use indentation (tabs). Each of the examples below demonstrate how this tab-controlled scoping works. Try modifying and uncommenting parts of the code to make sure you understand how to write each control structure. **Helpful tip: you can comment and uncomment a section of code by highlighting multiple lines and typing Ctrl+/.**"

    "## List Comprehension and Other Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension is a popular and very efficient way to create lists. If you hear someone talk about \"Pythonic\" code practices, this is one of them. **Quick tip: if you find yourself coding in Python for an interview, definitely build lists via list comprehension if possible.** List comprehension is when we build a list \"in-line\". This means we initialize and populate the list all in one line. The below code presents toy examples, but when we start working with real signals like audio, images, etc. this can save lots of time and code. Furthermore, take note again how we typecast the list to a numpy array after constructing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Array/list slicing and truth array indices are powerful techniques to extract collections of items from a list based on some conditions. Array slicing allows us to specify a range of indices we would like to extract from an array. Slices can indicate we want a specific segment, every element along a dimension, something like \"every other\" element, and more. The general format for array slicing can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``array[start:end]``\n",
    "2. ``array[start:end:step]``\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will start with the first option to extract a segment of an array (bonus: [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation) provides a nice reference for each option). We use a colon (:) to separate the arguments in our slices, and it is important to note that the second argument (``end``) is always **non-inclusive**. This means ``array[2:4]`` will return the elements at index 2 and 3 only. Furthermore, we may slice multiple dimensions at a time. Examples of array slicing and some of these more advanced cases are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also build a Boolean array by \"asking\" a condition of the elements in the array. By placing that Boolean array as the index for our original array, we are able to automatically pull out the values we want! Don't worry if this is all too abstract right now. The following code should make it more concrete. And, as always, take some time to play around with the code. Taking the time now to familiarize yourself with these tools will save tons of time in the future."

Therefore, we suggest you create each channel's image by first creating an array of zeros using $\\textrm{np.zeros()}$ with size matching the shape of ``img_color``. Then set the appropriate channel equal to the same channel in the original image using array slicing. Plot each channel's image in one figure using subplots.\n",
