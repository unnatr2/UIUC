Steve Jobs comes back home from a long day at the Apple office. He can’t decide what he should do first. Sit at his desk and work on new ideas, or make some dinner, or go to sleep.

# steve-desk
Steve sits at his table and works on his MacBook. He stares deeply into the beyond, trying to think of a new addition to the Apple EcoSystem.

# steve-cook
Steve goes to the kitchen and tries to look for something to cook. He’s torn between pasta and noodles.

# steve-sleep
Steve goes to his room. He’s trying to decide if he brushes his teeth before he sleeps or just watch some YouTube till he falls asleep.
